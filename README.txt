We really like the movie Inception, and we believe mimicking the movie's complex nature can help us better understand Git. First, the 7 characters from the movie are:

Ariadne
Arthur
Cobb
Eames
Robert Fischer Jr.
Saito
Yusuf

Assignment Steps
Create text files, one for each character listed above (Ariadne, Arthur, Cobb, etc.,)
Create the first directory called level_one and move all your characters into it
Create the next directory, level_two and move all but one character down into level_two
Keep going for 2 more levels (level_three, level_four or even limbo!)
Push your code to GitHub
